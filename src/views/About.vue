    <p>Recently I've delved back into tabletop games. At some point I will have to get a dungeon crawl game to
      our table. The DnD Adventure System (DnD AS) games (like Castle Ravenloft, Wrath of Ashardalon, Legend
      of Drizzt) are a good fit for us.  It doesn't require a DM (Dungeon Master), plays fast (games lasts
    within an hour or so, plus prep), and of course the classic Dungeons &amp; Dragons familiarity.</p>

    <p>This small Vue.js app features some utilities for campaign play, randomization and generation, plus other nifty stuff like easy house rules for any DnD AS game.</p>

    <p>As usual, you can send feedback on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/@kevinn">@kevinn</a> or contribute directly at the <a href="https://github.com/elintseeker/dndas-pocketdm">github repository</a>.</p>
