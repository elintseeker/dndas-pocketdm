    <p>Recently I've delved back into tabletop games. At some point I have to get a dungeon crawl game to our table. The DnD Adventure System (DnD AS) is a good fit as it doesn't require a DM (Dungeon Master), plays fast (games lasts in an hour or so), and the classic Dungeons &amp; Dragons familiarity.

    <p>This small vue.js app features some utilities for campaign play, randomization and other nifty stuff like house rules for any DnD AS game.</p>

    <p>As usual, you can contribute and/or send feedback to the <a href="#">github repository</a>.</p>
