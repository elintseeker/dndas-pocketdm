    <p>Recently I've delved back into tabletop games. At some point I realized that the household will have to
      get a dungeon crawl type of game to our table. The D&amp;D Adventure System (D&amp;D AS) games like Castle Ravenloft,
      Wrath of Ashardalon, Legend of Drizzt are a perfect fit for us.  It doesn't require a DM (Dungeon Master), plays
      fast (games lasts an hour or so, plus prep time), and of course the classic Dungeons &amp; Dragons familiarity.</p>

    <p>This small Vue.js app features some utilities for campaign play like randomization and generation, plus
      other nifty stuff like Hitpoint tracker, house rules for any D&amp;D Adventure System game.</p>
